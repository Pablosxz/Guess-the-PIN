# Project: Guess the PIN Game

## Description
This is a project of a simple JavaScript game called "Guess the PIN". The objective of the game is to challenge users to guess a 4-digit PIN. As users enter their guesses, the website provides feedback indicating whether the correct PIN is greater than, less than, or equal to the current guess. The game continues until the user guesses the PIN correctly or decides to end the attempt.
